## <center>A place to put your used media on the market! <br><br><a href="https://sell-react-ts.netlify.app/">Link</a> to deployed application.</center>

</p>

I built SELL as a used media marketplace concept because I collect vinyl records, blu rays/4k's, books, comics, and toys and wanted a place to put those on the market easily without Ebay's cumbersom verification and posting process. I also wanted to attract a network of folks interested in trading, as well as selling/purchasing used media. The intent behind SELL is that it's simple UI and dedicated purpose would set it apart from larger marketplaces like ebay.

  - If you need to edit, delete, or mark a listing as sold, navigate to your profile via the 'Profile' link in the nav bar and a list of your posts will be on the bottom of the screen.
